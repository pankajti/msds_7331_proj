    "We have selected the \"default of credit card clients Data Set\" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

    "To measure the outcomes from this dataset we would build an algorithm to predict how likely a customer is to default on their payment. This algorithm would use as many attributes as necessary from the given data set to most accurately predict this outcome. A credit card company would like to be able to predict this outcome for multiple reasons. One reason is to avoid customers who are not going to be able to pay on time. Another would be to be prepared with legal and other resources if clients do default. \n",
